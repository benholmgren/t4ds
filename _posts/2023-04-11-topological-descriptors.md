## Overview

To round off day 1, we will combine what you learned in the first two sessions to cover
the basics of computational topology. After learning the requisite theory,
we will present relevant examples in R for students to gain hands on experience.

This session is presented jointly by Brittany and Ben. Brittany will cover most of the
theory, and Ben will lead R programming sections.

### Objectives

After this session, we hope that you will  be able to:

> - Understand how topological shape can exist in data
> - Gain a working knowledge of persistence barcodes and diagrams
> - Gain exposure to the Vietoris-Rips and other complexes
> - Know how to begin the topological data analysis pipeline in R
> - Know how to conduct the Vietoris-Rips and the height filtration in R
