## Overview

In this session, we will have a light and fast introduction to the subject of
topology, a field of mathematics that stems from pure mathematics, but has
applications in data analysis that makes it an interesting subject to applied
mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, data scientists, and other
data scientists alike.

This session is presented by Brittany.
